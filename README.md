Forked from https://github.com/alistair23/meta-pine64 that is used as a kickstarting base.

This is a pet project of mine, mostly for the PinePhone. Github is used to share this across multiple devices.

If you want to use it, feel free - but note that there is no support. Also, there are a lot of bugs, most probably.

I recommend to visit the upstream project if you are looking for real value for the general public.
